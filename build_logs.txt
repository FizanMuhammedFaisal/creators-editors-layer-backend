//this is a fancy way to document new things i learn while building this project

Jul 1
finished db integration and schema design
i should create a branch and start building CRUD operations for workspaces 

and this is how we do it:
git fetch origin
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/workspace-crud
